# foodDelivery

I Build the food delievery  assignment having lots of functionity 
Menu page should display all the items from the menu
Menu page should have a search bar to search for an item
Menu page should have filters of isVeg , isSpicy and sort by price (both ascending and
descending).

Each item should have the button to add that item to cart. On click of the button, that food
item should be added to cart, for ordering it. Do this using context. If the item already exists in
the cart, make the button text as go to cart on the menu page

Cart page should show all the food items that were added to cart, the total price of all the
items in cart, and the total time required to deliver all the products in minutes

There should be an option to apply coupon which reduces the total cost by 5Rs of the total
amount
